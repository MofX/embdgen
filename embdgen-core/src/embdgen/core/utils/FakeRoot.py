    This allows file operations, that are usually only possible with root rights
    (e.g setting owner/group and creating device nodes).
    The files are created on the filesystem just like normal files and the attributes,
    that cannot be set directly are recorded in a state database.
    This can be used to create e.g. device nodes, that are later read by an archive tool
    or by a filesystem creator, where creating files with these attributes is allowed.

    This class provides the run-method with the same syntax as subprocess run and automatically
    wraps all executions into fakeroot.

    A fakeroot can reuse the state file of another fakeroot without modifying it.
